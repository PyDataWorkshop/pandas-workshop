Working with time-series data is an important part of data analysis.
Starting with v0.8, the pandas library has included a rich API for time-series manipulations.

The pandas time-series API includes:

Creating date ranges
From files
From scratch
Manipulations: Shift, resample, filter
Field accessors (e.g., hour of day)
Plotting
Time zones (localization and conversion)
Dual representations (point-in-time vs interval)
